## Intro

When you load up the page, you are greeted with a bunch of input boxes (along with some exposition).

The values you enter in these inputs determine the initial state of the simulation.

The simulation consists of an [environment](##Environment), your aim is to make is sustainable. If it survives for 20,000 years, you win!
