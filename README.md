# CREATURES

## A simulation of an environment where different creatures interact with the surroundings and each other

### Aim of this  is to create a sustainable environment

## Environment

1. Environment is made up of Plants (Moss - green, Musk - olive) and Creatures (Jeagers - red, Emono - blue)
2. Jeagers Feed on Emonos, Emonos Feed on Plants, Plants Grow on Creatures' droppings
3. Musk grows only where there is a high density of droppings.
4. Upon reaching a certain Size, Creatures/Plants Reproduce
5. All Creatures and Plants Evolve
6. Creatures will die if not fed for certain amount of time
7. Creatures/Plants will die when they get old

## Rules

1. You get to set the initial state of the Environment, which includes number of Moss and Creatures
2. You may speed up the timeline or chose to watch as your Environment changes
3. You will win if your Environment is sustainable, i.e. your Creatures are alive even after 10^5 years
